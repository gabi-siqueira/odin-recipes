            <ol>
                <li>The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies to to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl.<br>When doing this, make sure to Measure the flour correctly. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). Then, measure flour by scooping it into a measuring cup and leveling it with a knife.</li>
                <li>Next, cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter early by taking it out of the fridge at least two hours before baking so it's ready to go when you need it. You can also warm it in the microwave for about 7 seconds, but be very careful not to melt it.</li>
                <li>Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat to combine.</li>
                <li>Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the chocolate chips and beat until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
                <li>Once the cookie dough is finished, it's time to portion and roll the dough. I know many people eyeball it when making cookies, however I highly recommend using a cookie scoop.<br>Using a cooking scoop ensures that all the cookies are uniform in size so that they bake evenly.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough) and put the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. (So put the cookies in the oven as you preheat it). Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste amazing.</li>
                <li>Let'em cool down for 10 minutes and enjoy :)</li>
